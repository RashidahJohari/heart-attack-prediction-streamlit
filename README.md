# Heart Attack Prediction: Machine Learning Approach

## Classification Problem
The objective is to predict whether a person has more chance of heart attack based on 13 measurements of the features given.


### Data Set Information:

The diabetes dataset contains 13 features:

- Age : Age of the patient
- Sex : Sex of the patient
- exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
- ca: number of major vessels (0-3)
- cp : Chest Pain type chest pain type <br>
Value 1: typical angina <br>
Value 2: atypical angina <br>
Value 3: non-anginal pain <br>
Value 4: asymptomatic <br>
- trtbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
- chol : cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor
- fbs : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
- rest_ecg : resting electrocardiographic results <br>
Value 0: normal <br>
Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV) <br>
Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria <br>
- thalach : maximum heart rate achieved


The target of the dataset :  <br>
0= less chance of heart attack <br>
1= more chance of heart attack


## How to use it
clone repo and run it
heart_train.py is the script to train the data.
deploy.py is the script for deployment.
